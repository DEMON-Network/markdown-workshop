# R Exercise

## OASIS Data

You will be working with the oasis longitudinal dataset ([OASIS 2](https://www.oasis-brains.org/#data)). This is a free, open access dataset consisting of longitudinal MRI data in nondemented and demented older adults.

Weâ€™ll be downloading the data from http://www.oasis-brains.org/pdf/oasis_longitudinal.csv.

For those interested, a full explanation of the data can be found in:

Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS): Longitudinal MRI Data in Nondemented and Demented Older Adults. Marcus, DS, Fotenos, AF, Csernansky, JG, Morris, JC, Buckner, RL, 2010. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 22, 2677-2684. doi: 10.1162/jocn.2009.21407

> ## Reproduce and extend an analysis. 
> A small piece of exploratory analysis was done on the [`oasis`](./oasis_intro.md) dataset. While it was done in `RMarkdown` only the a html document is available. You want to reproduce and update this analysis. 
> 1. View the html report by right clicking on `R Worksheet` in the left hand menu, opening the link in a new tab. 
> 1. Create a fresh RMarkdown document and reproduce the given report. You'll need to look at the [cheat-sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) and you can copy and paste chunks of code if you wish. 
> 1. Knit to a pdf by selecting `Knit to pdf` from the `Knit` menu. How does the front matter change? 

> ## Advanced task
> 2. View the advanced html report by right clicking on `R Worksheet Advanced` in the left hand menu, opening the link in a new tab.
> 2. Adapt your RMarkdown document so that your report includes the additional features in the advanced report
