    "Let's start with the definition of literate programming (from Wikipedia):\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a computer program is given an explanation of its logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is a method for performing literate programming and is a powerful way of presenting your analysis in a way that's easy to code and easy to read. The \"snippets of source code\" are your Python syntax. The \"explanation of the its logic in a natural language\" is your analysis report.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will draw heavily from the following excellent resources:\n",
