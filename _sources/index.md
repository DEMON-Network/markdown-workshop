Welcome to the practical part of the workshop, where you will learn how to incorporate Markdown into your analysis in either `python` or `R`.  

During this part of the workshop, expert facilitators will be on hand to answer any questions or troubleshoot any problems you might have. If you would like to ask a question, you can unmute yourself or post it in the chat - whichever you feel more comfortable doing. If you feel it would be good to talk to a facilitator 1:1 then please post your question in the chat and raise your hand (virtually) and we will place you in a separate room with a facilitator when one becomes available.

You will find links to all of the material you need in the left hand menu. `R` users should use the material under `R` and likewise `python` users should use the material under `python`. 

Under `General` you will find a markdown cheat sheet which might come in handy during this session.
