# Exercise

> ## Reproduce and extend an analysis. 
> A small piece of exploratory analysis was done on the `oasis` dataset. While it was done in `colab` only the a html document is available. You want to reproduce and update this analysis. 
> 1. View the html report by right clicking on `Python Worksheet' in the left hand menu, opening the link in a new tab. 
> 1. Create a fresh colab notebook and reproduce the given report. You'll need to look at the [cheat-sheet](./cheat.md) and you can copy and paste chunks of code if you wish. 

> ## Results Table
> 2. Either using some of the analysis above, or through additional analysis of your own, create a summary results table below. What it includes is up to you, the overall aim is to get familiar with creating tables in markdown.
> 2. Export your notebook to a PDF. How does the front matter change?
