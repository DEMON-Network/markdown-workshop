# Python Exercise

## OASIS Data

You will be working with the oasis longitudinal dataset ([OASIS 2](https://www.oasis-brains.org/#data)). This is a free, open access dataset consisting of longitudinal MRI data in nondemented and demented older adults.

Weâ€™ll be downloading the data from http://www.oasis-brains.org/pdf/oasis_longitudinal.csv.

For those interested, a full explanation of the data can be found in:

Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS): Longitudinal MRI Data in Nondemented and Demented Older Adults. Marcus, DS, Fotenos, AF, Csernansky, JG, Morris, JC, Buckner, RL, 2010. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 22, 2677-2684. doi: 10.1162/jocn.2009.21407

> ## Reproduce and extend an analysis. 
> A small piece of exploratory analysis was done on the `oasis` dataset. While it was done in `colab` only the html document is available. You want to reproduce and update this analysis. 
> 1. View the html report by right clicking on `Python Worksheet` in the left hand menu, opening the link in a new tab. 
> 1. Create a fresh colab notebook and reproduce the given report. You'll need to look at the [cheat-sheet](./cheat.md) and you can copy and paste chunks of code if you wish. 

> ## Results Table
> 2. Either using some of the analysis above, or through additional analysis of your own, create a summary results table below. What it includes is up to you, the overall aim is to get familiar with creating tables in markdown.
> 2. Export your notebook to a PDF. How does the front matter change?
